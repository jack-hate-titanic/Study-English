最近有很多关于运动员犯罪活动的报道，以至于体育版开始看起来像警察报告了。  
these days there are so many stories about the criminal activities of athletes that sports page are beginning to look like police reports.

这是怎么呢？  
what's going on?

美国体育迷在吃早餐吐司和喝咖啡时问，我们的英雄发生了什么事?  
American sports fans ask over their morning toast and coffee, what's happening to our heroes?

不难理解我们希望运动员成为英雄的愿望。  
it's not difficult to understand our desire for athletes to be heroes.

至少从表面上看，运动员表现出一种生机勃勃、顽强不屈的精神;
on the surface, at least, athletes display a vital and indomitable spirit;

他们的身上充满了活力。
they are gloriously alive inside their bodies.

体育确实让我们见证了那些可以被合理地描述为勇敢、激动、美丽，甚至高尚的行为。
and sports do allow us to witness acts that can legitimately be described as courageous, thrilling, beaasutiful, even noble.

在一个日益复杂和无序的世界里，体育仍然是一个我们可以经常见证某种伟大的竞技场。
in a increasingly complicated and disorderly world, sports are still an arena in which we can regularly witness a certain kind of greatness.

然而，这里有一个悖论，因为一个社会倾向于在英雄身上寻找的品质——无私、社会意识等等-----，恰恰是把一个有天赋但其他方面不起眼的邻居孩子变成迈克尔·乔丹所需要的品质的对立面。
Yet there's someting of a paradox here, for the very qualities a society tends to seek in its heroes--selflessness, social consciousness, and the like ----- are precisely the opposite of those needed to thransofrm a talented but otherwise unremarkable neighborhood kid into a Michael Jordan.

要成为一名明星运动员，你必须有极强的竞争意识，你必须完全集中精力发展自己的身体技能。
To become a star athlete, you have to have an extremely competitive outlook and you have to be totally concentrated on the development of your own physical skills.

这些品质很可能造就一个伟大的运动员，但不一定造就一个伟大的人。
these qualities may well  make a great athlete, but they don't necessarily make a great person.

最重要的是，我们的社会通过它所创造的培养运动员的制度来强化这些特征——一个以有限的责任和巨大的特权为特征的制度。
on Top of this, our society reinforces these traits by the system it has created to produce athletes --- a system characterized by limited responsibility and enormous privilege.

运动员们自己承受着这个系统的成本。
The athletes themselves suffer the costs of this system.

许多年轻的运动员被训练成不断地用周围人的成就来衡量自己，从而形成了一种社会学家沃尔特·谢弗(Walter Schafer)所说的“有条件的自我价值”。
Trained to measure themselves perpetually against the achiveements of those around them, many young athletes develop a sense of what sociologist Walter Schafer has termed "conditional self-worth".

他们很快就知道，只要他们被视为“赢家”，他们就会得到生活中重要人物——父母、教练和同龄人的认可。
They learn very quickly that they will be recognized by the important figures in their lives--parents, coaches and peers as long as they are perceived as “winners”.

不幸的是，他们变得自负，并认为他们的运动成功将永远持续下去。
Unfortunately they become conceited and conceive as if their athletic success will last forever.
